I would have to say my biggest thank you is how you developed my insatiable love for jigsaw puzzles. We completed the most difficult ones in record time and when we got bored we would complete the largest ones on the opposite side with no picture at all.

He took care of them for many years until their passing. Unfortunately my father had various health issues of his own that interfered with his journey, but despite that he maintained a positive and optimistic mindset. He was a jokester amongst friends, and always open and ready to lend a helping hand. He resided in Englewood, and enjoyed being outdoors ready and listening to music at the park. He had been a chef before coming to the US. He would always tell stories of his experiences working for French restaurants in Peru and Venezuela. He attended mass regularly and was fond of St. Cecilia’s RC church next to his residence building.

He was the 3rd child of Nicholas and Hazel Cannizzaro. Nick didn’t have much schooling as his family moved from one place to another and for a while he lived with his maternal grandmother. He started work at a very young age, which was a common thing you saw for the times. At 17, he was walking along Market Street in Paterson and turned into the recruiting office to sign up for the Army. He radiated patriotism and had this new sense of pride. However, as fate would have it, he was discharged honorably at the request of his mother. Nick was needed at home to help support her and his four half brothers. He came home with the same love for the American Dream and drove trucks for a couple different companies until retirement; which he enjoyed. He supported his family without missing a beat, until fate stepped in once again. Janet entered his life and left her mark on his heart, forever. His first and only love, they married the following year as teenagers and made their way together in a small apartment in Paterson. They worked hard and bought their first home after their third child was born. A year later, they bought their second home that had a huge yard with a fence; this was a huge deal as Nick dreamed of owning a house with a yard this big. Their four children were raised in this home. Watching them play outside in their backyard with a pool and a dog, that pride he felt at 17 years old welcomed its way back into Nick’s life. He made sure to find some time to go fishing and hunting with his sons and to help out in the house from simple repairs to running the lawn mower. He wanted to show his family about the ties that bind a family. Nick worked hard his entire life, no complaints. So when he retired he finally had more time for himself and his family.","id":"nicholas-cannizzaro"},{"name_display":"Kathleen Capitelli","name_sort":"Capitelli, Kathleen","county":"Hudson","age":"76","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"","obit_link":"https://www.parowfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Kathleen--B-Capitelli?obId=12708353","other_link":"","blurb_optional":"\"Kathy was a mom, a grandmother, aunt, cousin sister & wife that was funny, brazen, blunt, stubborn and feisty.

My dad could fix anything, and if he didn’t know how, he’d find a way. He fixed our flat tires, put up shelves in our houses, painted, laid pavers down, you name it, if his 5 daughters needed him to do it, he was there! He was also the best cook! For as long as I can remember, my dad had a vegetable garden & if you stopped by the house during the season, you were definitely going home with a bag of veggies & he was definitely bragging about his growing avocado tree.  He was a fisherman and a hunter & when he had extra you’d go home with some too. He exercised almost daily, loved to travel and loved music, especially singing along to some mariachi. He would go to mass with my sister every Sunday & then would take us all to breakfast right after, always picking up the bill without question. If Real Madrid was playing, he was watching & if we were out while a game was on, you better believe he was pulling out his phone to watch the soccer game and he never knew how to lower the volume on his phone, so everyone around him knew the score too. & if he wasn’t home or with his family, or at Lubrizol working or at some random city council meeting then he was most likely at “El Club”. His smile was infectious and we’ll miss his little laugh. He was funny and loved to play pranks on people, especially his sister. Every time I saw him, it’s like he couldn’t help himself, he was doing something to make my life easier or better. He always talked about his family and was so proud of us all. We spent so much time together because family was his priority and it brought him joy to see us all together. He was an exceptional dad. \n\nHis friends all raved about how his friendship meant the world to them & how the pain of losing him was unbearable. His boss said wonderful things about my dad and how everyone loved him at his job of almost 22 years, my dad worked so hard & the messages we received from his coworkers was only proof of that. His cousins called to tell him what a beautiful person he was, they mentioned some way he had helped them throughout his life and how he left an impression on each of their lives. \n\nEven the mayor of Paterson called us to tell us what a great man my dad was & that was big because we know how many times my dad would reach out to him with little things like picking up the recycling on Paxton st. He was a devoted resident of Paterson.\n\nOld friends we hadn’t talked to or seen in years called us to tell us what a great man he was. How he impacted their lives in some way. How when their dads didn’t show up, my dad was there for them. They told us how they had to pay their respects because it was the right thing to do in order to honor the daughters of such an incredible man. \n\nHe was so much more than a dad, he was a brother, an uncle, a friend, a compadre, a confidant, a reliable-hard worker, a father in law, a grandfather to Kika, Amelia and Luca, & he even let us call him grandpaw to our pups.  We couldn’t have wished for a better dad, the only thing I wish for is more time with him. \n","id":"carlos-h-garcia"},{"name_display":"Hector Garcia","name_sort":"Garcia, Hector","county":"Bergen","age":"58","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/coronavirus/2020/08/03/coronavirus-nj-hector-garcia-loved-knowledge-and-his-son/5438145002/","id":"hector-garcia"},{"name_display":"Herminio Garcia","name_sort":"Garcia, Herminio","county":"Passaic","age":"77","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/coronavirus/2021/06/17/loved-and-lost-herminio-garcia-founder-mexican-independence-parade-passaic/4971747001/","id":"herminio-garcia"},{"name_display":"Joaquin \"Jack\" Garcia","name_sort":"Garcia, Joaquin \"Jack\"","county":"","age":"","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"","obit_link":"","other_link":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CCeGEfaDS3_/?igshid=1w2vecb6ak2jy&fbclid=IwAR2yk_Ac0fGrMfyvLbxja0XFuHe64IEHX6zHZWkrYZYKWwFpuKowfK6pR-s","id":"joaquin-\"jack\"-garcia"},{"name_display":"Miguel Garcia","name_sort":"Garcia, Miguel","county":"Union","age":"60","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"","obit_link":"https://www.tributearchive.com/obituaries/18916848/Miguel-L-Garcia/Elizabeth/New-Jersey/Las-Rosas-Bannworth-Funeral-Home","other_link":"","blurb_optional":"I thank God for your life on earth, your love, wisdom, unconditional love.

Mark was born on December 11, 1933. He lived in New Jersey for most of his life, with the exception of a few years in Florida, and worked for 37 years at Blue Cross-Blue Shield of New Jersey, retiring as manager of the computer center. Known to some as “Snooky,” before Jersey Shore was ever a thing, Mark was also known for his beautiful singing voice. He was invited to appear on an amateur hour television show, but had already enlisted in the Army, where he served proudly as a medic in Korea. He returned with a few Korean phrases that he used for the rest of his life. His love of music was passed to his children and grandchildren, and nothing pleased Mark more than seeing his family perform, especially the grandchildren during their annual Christmas Eve gathering. Mark had a wonderful sense of humor, and the term “dad joke” may have been coined in his honor. He was a great story- and joke-teller, often to the embarrassment of his family, such as when he asked his nurses to the prom. He loved the ocean, and lived in Seaside Park for several years, where he was an active member of several organizations, including the American Legion and the Moose Club. A voracious reader, he was especially fascinated by World War II books. Predeceased by his parents, Mark Joseph and Madeline Gertrude (Finnerty) Higgins, his sisters, Joan Burton and Shirley, and his brother Robert, Mark is survived by his adored children, Mark (Patricia), Donna Roth (Robert), and Lisa Daidone (J. Vincent); grandchildren Kevin and Kyle Higgins, Erin Morgan (Daniel); Jennifer (Jason Ephraim) and Dylan (Jenna Kass) Roth; and Vincent and Jillian Daidone. Mark is also survived by his great-granddaughter, Abigail Ephraim, and his brother, Patrick (Jane). The family would like to thank the staff at The Gardens at Monroe for the care given to Mark over the last several months. If you feel inclined, donations to the Wounded Warrior Project (https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/) would be appreciated. A memorial will be planned at a later date.","id":"mark-douglas-higgins"},{"name_display":"Marlene Hilke","name_sort":"Hilke, Marlene","county":"Essex","age":"62","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"","obit_link":"https://jacobhollefuneralhome.com/tribute/details/9890/Marlene-Hilke/obituary.html","other_link":"","blurb_optional":"\"A loving mother and grandmother, sister and a wonderful dedicated wife for 27 years.\"","id":"marlene-hilke"},{"name_display":"Michael Hill","name_sort":"Hill, Michael","county":"Gloucester","age":"58","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"","obit_link":"https://www.phillytrib.com/obituaries/michael-hill-58-longtime-regional-rail-conductor/article_869b0a11-a171-5757-80d2-8c308f2b5687.html","id":"michael-hill"},{"name_display":"Dr. Harvey Hirsch","name_sort":"Hirsch, Dr. Harvey","county":"Ocean","age":"68","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"https://www.app.com/story/news/2020/04/29/coronavirus-lakewood-beloved-pediatrician-harvey-hirsch-dies-covid-19/3047813001/","obit_link":"https://www.congregationbneiyisrael.com/obituaries/Harvey-Hirsch/","other_link":"","blurb_optional":"","healthcare_worker":"yes","id":"dr-harvey-hirsch"},{"name_display":"Elias \"Bob\" Hladik","name_sort":"Hladik, Elias \"Bob\" ","county":"Middlesex","age":"82","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"","obit_link":"https://mitruskafuneralhome.com/tribute/details/249/Elias-Hladik/obituary.html","id":"elias-\"bob\"-hladik"},{"name_display":"Nikolina Hluchan","name_sort":"Hluchan, Nikolina","county":"Bergen","age":"","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"","obit_link":"https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/northjersey/obituary.aspx?n=nikolina-hluchan-pervinich&pid=195918025&fhid=17158","id":"nikolina-hluchan"},{"name_display":"Marquita Hobbs","name_sort":"Hobbs, Marquita","county":"Essex","age":"64","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"","obit_link":"https://www.bucklandfuneralhome.com/obituary/Marquita-Hobbs","other_link":"https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-marquita-hobbs-memorial-fund","id":"marquita-hobbs"},{"name_display":"Richard Hogan","name_sort":"Hogan, Richard","county":"Monmouth","age":"75","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"","obit_link":"https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/app/obituary.aspx?n=richard-wayne-hogan&pid=196228789&fhid=27016","id":"richard-hogan"},{"name_display":"Harriet Shepardson Hohman","name_sort":"Hohman, Harriet","county":"Bergen","age":"94","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/coronavirus/2020/08/10/coronavirus-nj-harriet-hohman-ridgewood-felt-most-home-stage/5521961002/","obit_link":"https://www.vanemburgh.com/obituary/harriet-hohman","id":"harriet-shepardson-hohman"},{"name_display":"William J.

He fought 25 days for his life. Our last conversation was at 4 a.m. while he was at the hospital and he said “I’m sorry they are going to put me on a ventilator, the treatment they are giving me it’s not working, I love you.”\n\nHe was only 65 years old. He was married to his love of his life Julia Marin, my mother. They were married for 43 years. They met while in college and one day 30 years ago they packed their bags full of dreams and came to the USA. My mother lost her soulmate. \n\nIt still feels unreal. He was full of life and love for his family. He was a great father. I’m his only child and he was my best friend. My father was the person who saved me from all the difficulties in my life just by being there. He has never failed me. He always pushed me to do better. He always said “if a door closes keep looking for the window or new door, just keep going.”\n\n My father was a very resourceful person. One just has to look around his house and see all the things he fixed and built. He was very intelligent and wise at the same time. He always knew what to say to make you feel better even when he thought he didn’t know what to say. He always said “no matter how old you are, I will always be there.”\n","id":"pablo-marin"},{"name_display":"Reuven Maroth","name_sort":"Maroth,

Truly there is no better way to describe my Mom. She was an extraordinarily strong woman with an enormous capacity for love, kindness, and generosity. Her strength was best on display when it came to my brother Jonathan, who was diagnosed with autism at the age of 3 in 1989. At a time before early intervention and the average person's only understanding of autism was the movie Rain Man, my mom was a fierce advocate for Jonathan. She fought hard for him to have the education and service that would allow him to have the fullest life possible. She founded a parents organization at his special education school, so that his school would have a PTA just as mine did. This determination for Jonathan to have the same opportunities as any other child included, advocating for him to be included in regular education classes at Passaic Valley High School. One of the proudest days of her life was the day my brother received his high school diploma. It would not have been possible without her fierceness and determination. But this fierceness never made her hard. She was an incredibly kind and empathic person. I was always struck by how she always knew everyone’s story. From a clerk at Quick Check to dear friends, my mother always took the time to talk to everyone she met and learn about them. And if you were going through a difficult times, she would be one of the first people to call and make sure you were OK or help anyway she could. She was always doing for others an eternal caregiver. She was an avid reader and an amazing cook, and nothing made her happier than feeding people. At holidays she always made sure each person’s favorite dish was there, even if it meant making 10 different things. No one left her table anything but completely stuffed. Her love for her family was so clear in everything she did. It was this love and her strength that saw her through the recovery of a stroke in 2017. She was left unable to swallow for 9 months, but she did not wallow in the situation. She worked hard in her therapies charming everyone she met along the way till she regained her swallow and mobility. And through it all she remained the most amazing Mimi to my two sons. If playing in the backyard was not an option for her, then she would play endless hour of chess or sit on the floor and work on puzzles. She showered them with endless love and affection. Her passing has left a void in all of our lives. Just 20 days shy of her 60th birthday, there was still so much left for her to see and do.","id":"angela-suriano"},{"name_display":"Joe Suriano","name_sort":"Suriano, Joe","county":"Essex","age":"73","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"https://www.nj.com/highschoolsports/2020/04/beloved-former-nj-track-and-cross-country-coach-dies-from-coronavirus.html","obit_link":"https://www.leonardismemorialhome.com/obituary/Joseph-Suriano","id":"joe-suriano"},{"name_display":"Chai Suthammanont","name_sort":"Suthammanont, Chai","county":"Hudson","age":"68","photo_optional":"","profile_link":"","obit_link":"https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=chai-suthammanont&pid=196277451","id":"chai-suthammanont"},{"name_display":"Joseph J.
